              Inspired by how easily and efficiently a skateboard turns; major components of our system mimic both the function and description of skateboard trucks. The ‘Hanger’ powerfully transfers energy input from the straps to the bushings and onto the edges of
              your board. The Kingpin acts as a fulcrum, magnifying this energy through leverage. Traditional bindings diminish energy transfer by the flexing and bending of their baseplate, forcing you to crank your straps down harder, ride with more
              forward lean, or run taller and stiffer highbacks. This all leads to more foot fatigue and pain. NOW bindings bypass the middle of the snowboard and direct your energy right onto the board’s edges. They simply transfer more power to the
              board with less work, meaning your feet will stay more relaxed and comfortable, longer.

              NOW Binding’s kingpin tool-less technology allows you to swap your bindings from pow board to freestyle without the use of a screw driver.
            </p>
            <p>
              With the kingpin tool-less, everything is done by hand. It allows you to remove your hanger (binding frame) from your board while keeping the post/mounting discs (base plate) on the board. In doing so, your stance and angles always stay with the board.
              So every time you mount your hanger over the post, you do not need to check for binding angles or stance width.
            </p>
            <p>
              This tehnology allows for easier customization of your bindings, like swapping your bushings on the spot. It is really convenient for when you travel or want to swap your bindings between boards. It allows you to have multiple boards and one or two sets
              of bindings. It’s easy. It’s fast, and it’s a tool-less.
